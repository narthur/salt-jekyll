If you have opened this page, the Holy Spirit must be tugging at your heart
strings, calling you to assist God’s work through SALT Ministries. We do not
solicit funds—God does the soliciting for us!

SALT Ministries operates for the Cambodian people. We provide a variety of
services, mostly free of charge, which are aimed at bringing people into a
saving relationship with Christ. Your donation(s) will help us to continue
providing these services.

The administrative costs of SALT Ministries are kept to an absolute minimum, so
that more than 98% of your gift reaches the people it was intended for (2% is
allowed for money transfer fees).

Whether you would like to know more about how you can support the work of SALT
Ministries in any of the areas listed below, or leave it up to us as to how your
donation is put to use, please contact us personally. We would love to hear from
and talk with you!

<h2>Butterfly Paradise</h2>

<p>{% include image.html name="give/BP Butterfly 1.jpg" width="960" height="573" %}
Read more about this newest project here. Funds will go toward creating and
developing a beautiful butterfly garden for tourists, in our own backyard. This
is an income generation project which will hopefully make SALT Ministries a
fully self-supporting ministry, and potentially a donor ministry.</p>

<h2>Children’s Education</h2>

<p>{% include image.html name="give/ED Flag raising.jpg" width="4272" height="2848" %}
Many dorm and village students are not able to pay for their school tuition.
Sponsorships help children to be able to continue attending school. Funds also
pay our Cambodian teachers, and provide for copy paper, textbooks, and other
materials the children need to study. (All of our foreign teachers work on a
  volunteer basis.)</p>

<h2>Multimedia Production</h2>

<p>{% include image.html name="give/MU Green Screen.JPG" width="960" height="720" %}
Your gifts will support office needs, as well as current multimedia projects
(which you can read about here). These funds are also used to pay our Cambodian
cameramen, video editors, and designers who work in our production office. As
the materials we produce are available to the Adventist population free of
charge, support of this ministry is very beneficial to evangelism in Cambodia.</p>

<h2>Orphanage</h2>

<p>{% include image.html name="give/OR Kids 3.jpg" width="720" height="540" %}
Our nine orphanage families rely on your support for their daily needs—food,
personal necessities, clothing, bedding, and education. We also host a yearly
birthday party for the orphanage children, and provide them each with a few toys
and other gifts to let them know that they are special to us.</p>
