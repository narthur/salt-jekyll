Tim and Wendy Maddocks began church planting in the Siem Reap town in 1992 while
Tim worked for the Adventist Development and Relief Agency as a development
project manager. Prak Heng and his family were some of the fruit of that church
planting work. Tim and Wendy selected Heng and his family to assist them in the
next church plant which was to be in Sombua, west of the Siem Reap town in the
neighborhood of what is now Wat Preah Yesu. By the time the first Lay training
program began in the middle of 1998, some 16 people had been baptized from the
local community surrounding Wat Preah Yesu, and beyond. Nine of these new
Christians joined the first lay training program in preparation for going out on
new church plants. At the end of the first Lay Training program in December
1998, SALT Ministries was ready to begin 9 new church plants while continuing
the church plant at Sombua. These church plants were made possible by a grant
from ASI a laymenâ€™s ministry based in the United States.

Today there are 13 groups meeting that have their origins from that original
project. SALT Ministries funds 1 full-time Bible worker to continue the spread
of the Gospel in Siem Reap town. The aim is to strengthen the Siem Reap town
congregation originally started by Tim and Wendy in 1992.
