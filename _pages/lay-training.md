Studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of the horse to the human. Horses
are especially impacting the lives of thousands of troubled young people around
the world today.

We believe that through working with horses in the Hooftrek horsemanship program
at Wat Preah Yesu, children can learn more about God and themselves, as well as
how to build healthy relationships, set boundaries, read body language, and gain
self-awareness and self-confidence.

There are already a number of different programs at WPY that we involve young
people in, to aid them in their spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical
growth. We believe that Hooftrek will be another benefit in helping the kids
grow into healthy, useful, whole citizens of the kingdom of Heaven. We want this
program to bring glory to God and lead more people into a growing relationship
with Him.

We have put together three 12-week courses that will run during the school
terms, and during the holidays we plan to have horsemanship/riding camps. We
hope to work with at least 50 of our young people each year.

Hooftrek currently has a small piece of the WPY property where we have set up a
couple of paddocks, riding areas, and a small stable. It is exciting to
contemplate the possibilities of this program and all the people that will
benefit from it!
