  <h1>What Is Salt?</h1>

  <p>SALT Ministries exists to help Cambodian people experience life transformation that happens when a person allows
  themselves to experience the presence of God. To this end, we pursue activities that will create an environment
  conducive to living in God's presence. We are committed to cooperative support of the Mission of the Seventh-day
  Adventist Church in Cambodia, while choosing by faith to operate financially independent of the Cambodia Seventh-day
  Adventist Mission.</p>

  <p>Click on one of the headings above to learn more about how God is using SALT Ministries to help finish His work in
  Cambodia.</p>

  <p>May you experience the joy of God's presence today!</p>
