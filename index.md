Our goal is to help Cambodians experience the transformed life that results from being in God's presence. We work to organize and pursue activities that will promote this type of environment.

We are committed to supporting and working together with the Cambodia Seventh-day Adventist Mission. At the same time, we choose by faith to operate financially independent of the Mission.

Read stories about how Cambodians have found joy in Christ. Discover our newest enterprises. Find out how you can be a part of our team! Learn more about how God is using SALT Ministries to help finish His work by clicking on one of the links above.

May you experience the joy of God's presence today!
